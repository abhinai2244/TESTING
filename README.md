#Paytm Transaction Verification Bot

This is a Telegram bot that verifies Paytm transactions and grants access to users who have completed payments. The bot is built using the python-telegram-bot library and includes features for payment handling and user interaction.

#Features

Start Command: Users can initiate the bot and get instructions for making payments.

Payment Verification: Accepts a Paytm transaction ID and verifies it using a specified API.

Custom Responses: Notifies users of the payment status, including success, amount mismatch, or verification failure.

Inline Keyboard: Provides a button for users to access the Paytm payment page directly.

Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and server errors gracefully.

#Requirements

python-telegram-bot library

A Paytm payment verification API endpoint

Telegram Bot Token

#Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/paytm-bot.git
cd paytm-bot

pip install python-telegram-bot requests

Set up your Paytm verification API and Telegram bot token:

Replace the placeholders for BOT_TOKEN and PAYTM_VERIFY_API in the script.

#Usage

Run the bot:

python Pay.py

Interact with the bot on Telegram:

Send /start to begin.

Follow the instructions to make a payment and send the transaction ID.

#How It Works

Start Command (/start):

Welcomes the user and provides a payment link and instructions.

Transaction Verification:

Users send their Paytm transaction ID to the bot.

The bot sends the transaction ID and user ID to the specified verification API.

Based on the API response, the bot informs the user if the payment was successful or if there was an error (e.g., amount mismatch).

Error Handling:

If the API cannot be reached or returns an error, the bot notifies the user.

Invalid commands trigger a response with guidance to restart or provide a valid transaction ID.
